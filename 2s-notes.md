murky depths: AoE
double impact: Stack Buster
sewage deluge: spawns the flood, mid not safe, one cornor platform not safe, party to oposite platform

Winged Cataract: 2 aoes from boss, body is not safe, side head is looking is safe
spoken cataract: 2 aoes from boss, body is not safe, side head facing not safe
coherance: tank buster on tehtered target -> party stack

shockwave, kb centered on boss -> light party stacks centered on healers

preditory avarice: puts 2 debuffs which cause an aoe (one on t/h one on dps) and 1 which does a stack (on a healer).  resolves after next mechanic.

channeling flow: emerald ex p2 kb's, take these to the edge and point toward the middle be careful not to overlap these

sewage deluge 2 (kampeos harma): this is limit cut, markers go out after kb squares: 1,3 oposite to the jump/ 2,4 to the jump handle like m/f dashes, triangles: cardnals just put 1,2,3,4 where those are supposed to go

channeling overflow: kb's come in 2 sets designated by the debuff timer, people not getting knocked back will get an aoe
                     if you make a straight line through the 2 cornors intercardinal to each other that are safe, the aoes will be resolved on the side with the flooded corner, the kb's will be resolved on the side with the non-flooded corner

dissosiation: head comes off and does a dive bomb of one half of the arena

dissosiation + preditory averice: one corner will be safe, party stacks on the platform, aoe debuffs get away from the party

https://clips.twitch.tv/MistyTrustworthyPlumberPipeHype-vaJUEL2CisIojdbF (with water)
dissositation + sewage eruption + tainted flood: party goes one platform, then rotates slowly as they drop aoes through the safe half of the arena, after which party spreads on the sewer grates for aoes

https://clips.twitch.tv/SmilingCoweringSwallowLitty-Y3XgdIBw9bfXNKOp
channeling overflow + coherence: Long debuff tank takes the coherence tether all the way to the bad platform, other long debuffs need to be on the platforms in a way that they will not get hit by the short debuff kb's or another aoe.  coherence stack is after the first kb but before the second.  after the stack the short debuff people will do the same spread the long debuffs just did, long debuffs will get knocked back

ominous bubbling: kb -> stacks
