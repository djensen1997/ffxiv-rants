# p7s Notes

## Baisc Cast Bars
Spark of Life: blead aoe
Dispersed Aero II: bleed buster aoe
Condensed Aero II: Stack bleed buster
Immortal's Obal: CHanges the arena, proximity + exas
    - head to one of the 2 north safe spots next to the exas and get knocked up inside the safe spot
    - wait out the remaining exas
    - try to be as far north as possible to avoid exas comming from the other 2 platforms
Bough of Attis: queues KB from one side of the boss toward S platform
Multicast: the boss swiftcasts multiple mechs
Roots of Attis: breaks all paths

## Forbidden Fruit
spawns adds on all 3 platforms

add sets:
- 3 birds: line aoes through the pathways between platforms
- beasts: PBAoE, melts, (I assume this does dmg on the melt)
- minnotaurs: spawns 4 eggs, one of them will be unique from the other 3
        - the 2 non-unique platform eggs will tether players with a proximity attack (likely a line attack)
        - the unique one will tether 4? players with a protean bait
- 4 birds: proteons + towers
    - 4 players are tethered to a bird, they have to bait the bird's dash
    - non tethered players get towers QED
    - looks like this will be t/h / dps groupings
    - arm's length the proteon hits (birds do a kb as predicted)

### Pattern 1 - https://youtu.be/yBW_HSQWDGs?t=71
line aoe across the midddle of all 3 paths between platforms
split into light parties for stacks
safe spots are on the platforms next to the line aoe
looks like also an in/out going on here, tell is the same as megabot from copied factory

### Pattern 2
Kb into birds
Spreads
2 ppl to each of the 4 north platforms, 4 on the S platform
spreads go off as birds go off


## Inviorate Bonds
2 debuffs, Holy Bonds and Inviolate Winds
Holy bonds is a stack and inviolate winds is a spread
Spreads on the intercard of platform, stack in rough middle
Look at the roman numeral for the debuff to tell you which order you are doing the mechanics in
(Looks like tank/healer and dps groups, i.e. tank/healer gets stack 1 and dps gets spread 1 or vice versa)

- Handle the first set of mechs on the S platform
- After first set of mechs, move N, and adjust to the safe side which does not have the KB
- Handle 2nd set of mechs on that safe platform

## Roots 1
Split into light parties on 2 of the 3 platforms
Take stack on platform
Wait until new path forms
Dodge Beasties on new paths

## Multicast

### Pattern 1
KB -> Spreads
pre-position for spreads and arm's lenght the kb

### Pattern 2
KB -> Stacks with exacs
get kb with your light party into a safe spot from exas


## Light of life
Spread stacks from inviorate bonds
birds to cleave paths
egg which defines non bird platform
after each set of mechs, leaves a delayed donut
How to drop spreads: https://youtu.be/yBW_HSQWDGs?t=436
Medium AOE after each mechanic, make sure to group mid between mechs for da eels

Spreads will alternate platforms, stakcs will always go to the same plaform, as in, if you have stack II, you go to the stack platform, if you have spread II, you go to the odd egg platform

## Harvest Roulette

- Forbidden Fruit - birds
    2 platforms get birds, and party has baited chase aoe, go do the safe platform (w/o bird), run through the path that doesn't have a bird hitting through it

- Famine's Harvest - Minnotaurs - https://youtu.be/yBW_HSQWDGs?t=508
    - find the platform that has 2
    - 4 party members who have a proximity tether need to stretch the tether
    - everyone else to the far side of the platform
        - after baits, run toward one of the minnotaurs to dodge bird aoes

- Death's Harvest - Beasties
    - find empty bridge
    - all tethers from the same beast should be taken on the same platform
    - don't be on the platform with a beast on it
    - don't be on bridges

- War's Harvest - combined
    - 4 ppl get beast tether and need to take on platform with beast
    - 2 ppl get bird thethers, take on bridges?
    - 2 ppl get stretch tethers
    - TODO: find strat which works for this mech
