## Purpose

This document is set here to lay out in maticulous detail why physical ranged in Final Fantasy XIV need a buff and should in their current iteration be dealing roughly the same dps as melee dps or casters.  This essay assumes a baseline understanding of what each job does and core job mechanics for each job.

## The Role - An overview

Physical Ranged as a role comprises the jobs Bard, Machinist, and Dancer, each wielding some sort of ranged weapon and all capable of dealing damage from mid to long range.  All physical ranged jobs share two characteristcs, the ability to deal damage from mid to long range (15y - 25y) and no cast times.  These characteristcs make physical ranged the perfect choice for many machanics which require a member of your party to break off from the party to bait damage and abilities.  Along with these basic characteristcs, all physical ranged jobs, like every other role in FFXIV, share a common pool of job actions, which at the time of writing this piece are `Head Graze` (A silence), `Foot Graze` (a root), `Leg Graze` (a heavy), `Peloton` (an out of combat party movement speed increase), `Second Wind` (a self 500 potency heal) and `troubador/tactician/shield samba` (a party wide 10% damage mitigation).

## The Movement

When played at the highest levels, even though all three physical ranged can in theory hit the boss from up to 25y while moving, the reality is often quite different.  Dancer has 2 melee (5y) GCD's that they need to execute every minute when single target, and in any amount of AOE turns into a melee job itself.  Along with the 2 melee GCD's dancer most execute every minute, they also have `Standard Step` and `Technical Step`, both of which are 15y (actually closer to 12.5y) AOE abilites, and both of which most hit party memebers to get their full effect.  `Standard Step` must hit the Dancer's `Closed Position` partner and `Technical Step` must hit the entire party in order to get the full use of the ability.  This means that for most of the fight, a dancer is not going to want to stray more than 10y away from the boss at any given time because they will take a big loss by doing so.  There is still one more reason Dancer is limited in movement, that is `Curing Waltz`, a 3y aoe heal centered on the Dancer and the Dancer's `Closed Postiion` partner, and in order to get the correct use of this ability, the entire party must be in a stack no larger in radius than 3y.  Bard and Mechinist have their own issues with movement as well.  Bard has the `Apex Arrow` ability which takes a variable time to charge (based on how many procs the bard gets in its rotation) and hits targets in a line aoe.  The reason this ability is problamatic in terms of movement is because if the boss moves during the cast, or the bard doesn't position the aoe correctly on the boss, a feat that is harder to accomplish while moving, the ability can "miss" its target similar to Dragoon's `Geirskogul` ability.  Machinist has a `Hypercharge` window occurring every roughly 40s which makes manuvering difficult because the Machinist player is focusing in a 1.5s GCD with mandatory weaves to maintian optimal dps, which understandably makes movement harder during these windows.

When compared to melee, physical ranged jobs can appear to have a few distinct advantages over melee dps.  For instance, the ability to hit the boss from most ranges gives physical ranged the ability to manuver more than a melee could in just about any situation, which can make the job feel safer than a melee dps.  This however is not entirely accurate when looking at the individual jobs and the raid as a whole.  In raids, 80% - 90% of the fight is going to be spent near the boss to ensure healers can easily aoe every target and raid utility affects every target, this means that even though physical ranged can technically fight the boss from any point on the map at any given time, doing so will cause the physical ranged to take more damage because it missed aoe mitigation, and in many cases causes physical ranged to die straight up due to missing key raid heals such as `Earthly Star` and `Asylum`.  Additionally, melee jobs are designed with the fact that they need to be in "melee range" for the most part. In order to do damage, each melee job has one to several ways that it can position itself easily in combat to deal optimal damage while executing mechanics.  Samari has `Yatan/Enpi` and `Gyoten`, Ninja has `shukuchi`, Monk has 2 charges of `shoulder tackle` and Dragoon has a varitable arsonal of jumps which can position it either at the boss or 15y away.  On top of their movement abilites, SAM and NIN also have the ability to attack the target from ranged for a strech of time, either for 1 gcd or up to 4 respectively, giving both of these melee the ability to manuver away from the boss for short periods of time to execute mechanics.  Moving away from the boss is admitadly harder for Monk and Dragoon players because they don't have any such ability to hit the boss from mid range, however, Monk has `6 Sided Star` which lengthens their GCD making it easier to move away from the boss quickly to execute a mechanic, and drg has `Elusive Jump`, a non-targeted 15y jump back which they can use to minimize the time spent away from the boss.  In most endgame Savage fights, an optimal Pysical Ranged player, taking all of this into account should only get a few more GCD's on the boss than an optimal melee player.

When compared to casters, physical ranged jobs again appear to have the upper hand, because how could a job that has to cast at least half of its GCD's be able to compete with the precieved mobility of physical ranged.  Quite simply, each caster job has ways to deal with their limitation of being a stationary turret.  Red Mage is perhaps the easiest to see this with, seeing as Red Mage has a 25y targetted dash, a 15y targetted jump back and has the `Duelcast` passive, which allows Red Mage to instant cast every other ability.  Along with these tools, RDM also has a melee range attack combo which does not require a cast for 3 1.5s GCD's followed by 2 instant cast 2.5 - Spell Speed GCD's totally roughly 10s of ability to move.  This happens roughly every minute, but with changes in Shadow Bringers, an optimal RDM play can plan when the melee combo is available and use that for easy movement for many mechanics which only require movement near the boss.  For mechanics further from the boss, RDM has the caster roll action `Swiftcast` which it can use to chain three GCDs together which allows the RDM to execute most ranged mechanics, if extra movement is requried without time to stop for a cast, the RDM can also use `Reprise` for an extra bit of ranged damage.  Summoner, while starting Shadowbringers as the least mobile job in the game, has grown into a new role as a "King" among dps because of its high dps output, battle raise, and high movement.  Every minute in a SMN's rotaiton, it gets a trance, either `Dreadwyrm Trance` or `Firebird Trance`, both of which reduce cast times by 2.5s and allow the Summoner 15s of free movement before ending, making at least 25% of a SMN's rotation completely mobile.  If that were all though, SMN would be a good argument for casters not being able to match a physical ranged's mobility, however, on top of the trance mobility, SMN also has one of its dots as an instant cast spell (`Bio III`), `Egi-Assults` as instant cast 2 charge spells, and can stack up to 4 stacks of instant cast `Ruin IV` making Summoner able to execute just about every mechanic a boss would throw at it without losing a singe GCD or point of potency off its main rotation.  Black Mage has a reputation for being an immobile mage in Final Fantasy XIV, since before Stormblood, the only way it could move and get its usual uptime was with a lucky proc or with the caster roll action `Swiftcast`, however, since Stormblood launched, BLM has been slowly accumulating more tools to enhance its movement capabilites.  On a 60s cooldown and allowing 3 free casts, `Triple Cast` is perhaps the easist way for BLM to get extra movement, but it isn't the only way for BLM to squeeze extra uptime out of a fight.  BLM can also stack 2 `Xenoglossy` stacks (one every 30s) which allows the BLM to cast a powerful instant cast spell.  `Sharpcast` also has been reduced in cooldown to 30s, so every loop of a BLM rotation, the BLM can use `Sharpcast` on `Thunder III` or `Fire` in order to have an extra instant cast ablity. Concievable, with all of these tools, a good BLM player can queue up 60s of straight instant cast abilities and barely take a loss off of using them, making BLM a significantly more mobile job that it apears to be.

Clearly, Physical Ranged jobs hardly have a monopoly on easy movement, with just about every DPS job in the game able to either barely take a loss or not take a loss at all for having to execute a mechanic.  This loss, lets say is 1 GCD/ minute in the worst case, leading to a roughly 2-5% loss in damage depending on the job, making the movement of physical ranged jobs, which is not unlimited, worth between 340rdps in the best case and 900 in the worst case, using current average number of blm taking a 5% loss and Ninja taking a 2% loss in a generic Savage fight with gear at ilvl 500.  Losing a full gcd in a fight every minute is highly unlikely though, even for blm, so the low end of 340rdps is probably what a physical ranged job's movement is worth in the average case assuming a fight requires jobs to break off of the boss to execute mechanics every minute, which no fight this expansion has required so far.  The simple fact is that every mechanic in Savage which is usually assigned to a physical ranged can be executed by a SAM or Nin with next to no loss and only Living Liquid and BJ/CC have required casters to map their movement cooldowns.  Because of every job's ability to maintain the majority of its uptime, movement should only be considered for part of the dps formula when comparing a Physical ranged to Monk or to Dragoon.

## Utility

A common belief among the Final Fantasy Raid community is that Physical Ranged is the "Support DPS" role because of the tools it has had in past expansions.  Hovever, in Shadowbringers, physical ranged jobs, on average, do not bring enough utility to justify their damage defficit from melee and caster jobs, and in many cases, bring less utility than most melee / caster jobs.  For the sake of sanity, utlity is going to be defined in this essay as any ability which is a non-dps ability which brings some function to the party outside of the normal sphere of what the job is supposed to do.

### Utility Analysis

While Bard and Dancer both bring some unusual utility, it is overshadowed by the utility available from the other roles you can bring to a raid.  Minne and Improve are both bad versions of mantra, Curing Watz is a worse version of Pheonix Regen, and aside from those, the only extra utility that physical ranged jobs bring are damage buffs, and an instant cast esuna from bard, but that hasn't been used in a strategy in a savage fight since Warrior had Pacification on its burst window.  Troub is often a worse party mitigation tool than Addle or feint because of where it applys in the stack for taking party damage, and having a longer cooldown.  It should be noted that troubador does have a longer duration than Addle and Feint, but it is still in most cases only usable on one ability, and Machinist just straight up has the least utility in the game.  Based on this enumeration of each dps job's utility, the only job which has an argument for having worse utility than a physical ranged is Dragoon because it doesn't have any self mitigation tools and no good way to deal ranged damage., and in their current state, no physical range job can be in good faith considered a "Utility" job.

## Damage Analysis

Onto the good stuff, how the damage numbers for physical ranged stack up with the other dps jobs. The following chart was pulled from fflogs.com at 2020-04-24T10:23:00-5:00 and shows a 99% parse for each job on a generic savage fight from data gathered from Eden's Verse (Savage) fights, sorted by rdps decending.

Class | RDPS | Max | Parses
Summoner | 18,111.61 | 18,730.53 | 38,171
Black Mage | 18,102.13 | 18,858.98 | 22,027
Samurai | 17,924.97 | 18,654.49 | 36,899
Ninja | 17,561.75 | 18,132.54 | 25,327
Monk | 17,475.59 | 18,137.32 | 17,924
Red Mage | 17,458.56 | 18,218.83 | 22,773
Dragoon | 17,427.89 | 18,183.86 | 38,479
Machinist | 16,668.96 | 17,042.36 | 29,416
Dancer | 16,650.63 | 17,680.72 | 26,743
Bard | 16,384.56 | 16,906.37 | 20,849 

This table shows a disturbing gap between physical ranged at the 99% and literally every other job in the game also at a 99%, but for the purpose of this arguemnt, lets focus on SMN, BLM, SAM and NIN.  Since you can only take 4 dps jobs into a raid in Final Fantasy XIV, space is at a premium and the jobs that you pick can have a huge impact on how your group performs overall.  In previous expansions, since physical ranged brought utility that was often critical to completing raids, it was concidered foolish to pass one up for your group, but in Shadowbringers, on average, physical ranged utility is LESS than the 4 top perfoming jobs on fflogs.com, so is it worth it to bring a physical ranged over one of these four jobs in a generic raid setting?  In order for it to be worth bringing a physical ranged, instead of the worst performing of the top four, Ninja, the physical ranged would need to be within the 1% rdps buff that was added in Shadowbringers to try to force parties to take at least 1 job from each of the 5 roles in the game (Tank, Healer, Melee, Physical Ranged, Caster), so lets do some math.  Assuming that your party comp has the best performing jobs in the game for their roles right now, Summoner, Black Mage, Samurai, Ninja, Astrologian, White Mage, Gunbreaker, Paladin, your party will have a 99% rdps of 114,455.27 before accounting for the 5% rdps buff.  Based on this number, the 1% rdps buff for Eden's Verse (Savage) is worth 1090rdps, calulated by taking abs(MAX_RDPS / 1.05 * 1.04 - MAX_RDPS).  According to the chart pull from fflogs, Machinist is currently the best physical ranged for rdps at the 99% and is 892.79 rdps behind Ninja, so if the choice is between brining the theoretical max comp or a phys ranged instead of a ninja, the answer is yes, it is slightly worth it to bring a physical ranged, so long as machinist's lack of personal mitigation and party utility is not a hinderance on the party.  That being said, if the choice is to bring a physical ranged or a caster, the choice is clear, Black Mage and Summoner are both about 1400 - 1500 rdps ahead of Machinist and both bring better utility than Machinist.

## How to Fix Physical Ranged

So throughout this essay, the argument for why physical ranged needs a buff has been layed out in its entirety, and even though in a generic fight using 99% data, physical ranged was worth bringing, it was barely worth bringing and in fact, Bard was not worth bringing at all based on the data from Eden's Verse (Savage), and going through each individual fight on fflogs, it becomes clear that physical ranged is lacking, even in fights where it is supposedly getting a let up on melee and casters (e7s and e8s), so, how can we fix physical ranged so that the job can perform beter and be more impactful going forward

### Potency Buffs 

Any chagne to physical ranged to make them perform better is going to have to involve potency buffs, these don't need to be big, because right now, physical ranged is barely on the the point of being good enough to not worry about, so here are some of my suggestions for each job, as an expert on physical ranged

#### Bard Potency Buffs

In Shadowbringers, Bard has lost a large part of its identity from foes requium being removed from the game and its dots not dealing as much damage proportionally to Heavy Shot / Burst Shot.  This has made snapshotting buffs on dots for Bard a dps loss and has removed a large part of the flavor of the job, leaving us with a generic proc job.  I propose the following changes to increase Bard's damage to be closer to RDM / DRG levels:

- Dot Potency Increase: 90 potency -> 110 potency (where they were at the beginning of the xpac).  At this level, it is still a dps loss in most cases to snapshot buffs, but at least they feel worth focusing on as a core aspect of the job.  This should result in a 300-400 dps increase single target
- `Shadowbite` `Bane` Dots: Dotting aoe can be a pain in dungeons and often bards are forced to choose between dotting and just using aoe without any dots, but with putting a `Bane` effect on `Shadowbite`, Bard players would have a far easier time managing the Bard aoe rotation on any number of targets.
- Allow Bards to benefit for the effects of their songs.  Currently, all three "Auras" that bard puts out do not apply to the Bard, and `Battle Voice` does not apply to the Bard.  This should result in a 400-500 dps increase single target.

With these changes implemented, bard would be dealing 17,000 - 17,300 at the 99% in a generic Eden's Verse fight by my estimation, which puts it in a far better state when compared to most of the other dps jobs.

#### Machinist Potency Buffs

- 4 stacks of charged actions: this will not result in a large dps increase, probably 50 - 100 at best, but it does make the job far better to play in situations which requrie a lot of movement and makes the job better to play with ping
- Wildfire should be able to DH/Crit: Wildfire is the largest potency hit in Machinist's arsonal, but it does not have the ability to DH or Crit due to technical debt from how it worked in Heavensward and Stormblood, allowing this ability to DH/Crit will let Machinests spec into crit and dh with more peace of mind knowing that it benefits their entire kit.  this will result in, by my estimation using a 550 dps number for each wild fire, a 47% dh rate and a 30% crit rate, 100 - 150 dps increase.
- Increase Drill and Air Anchor dmg to 750 potency: As a core part of maintaining good damage, making drill and air anchor do more damage should result in a nice dps increase without having to relearn any part of the job.  Should result in a 200 - 350 rdps increase.

With All of these changes in place, machinist at the 99% should see a new dps output of between 17,000 and 17,300 making it even with where bard's rdps output would be.

#### Dancer Potency Buffs

- Add 50 potency to `Reverse Cascade` and `Fountainfall`: Right now, these two abilites were suspisiously left out of the potency buffs dnc recieved in 5.2 and made the numbers the job has awkward. This will result in a 300 - 350 potency increase.
- Add 50 potency to `Saber Dance`: This will result in a 180 - 220 dps increase

With these two changes, dnc should be doing 17,130 - 17,200 rdps putting it comparable with the other two Physical Ranged DPS

### Utility Buffs

You may have noticed that with these changes, physical ranged will still be doing less damage than other jobs in the game.  This is because physical ranged needs to have an identity of its own if the game is to maintain a healthy meta and raid scene, with this in mind, I suggest the following changes to the utility of physical ranged

#### Role Actions

- Refresh: this was a powerful tool in Stormblood which allowed healers to be a little more loose with their mana and made physical ranged desired in raids even above casters, who at the time did more damage.
- Troubador / Tactician / Shield Samba: Increase mitigation to 15%; reduce duration to 10s, this will make it a little better than feint or addle, but it will still have a longer cooldown to offset that.

#### Bard Utility

- Nature's Minne: Reduce cooldown to 45s

#### Machinist Utility

- Give machinist a personal mitigation tool, like `Third Eye` or `Shade Shift`
- Give Machinist a targeted dash to the boss, like a grapler hook

#### Dancer Utility

- Rework imporv to work like mantra (i.e. no channle and no gague gain)
- Increase Radius of curing waltz to 6y

## Conclusion

Physical Ranged at the current moment is in a really bad place.  They are constantly at the bottom of the dps charts and don't have the tools to warrent being there, but with a few targeted buffs to key abilities are the return of refresh, physical ranged do not have to do more damgage than the other dps to be valuable.
